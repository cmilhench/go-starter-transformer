# Golang API Transformer

## Overview

This project demonstrates a lightweight, idiomatic Golang application that:
- Fetches data from a source API
- Transforms the received JSON
- Sends the transformed data to a destination API

Using only the standard library, this example is designed to give a clear, 
beginner-friendly approach to working with APIs in Go.

## Features

- Pure Go implementation using standard library
- Modular package structure
- Contextual timeouts for HTTP requests
- JSON transformation
- Error handling
- Separation of concerns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Go](https://golang.org/) installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Go, HTTP, and JSON.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `go mod tidy` to ensure dependencies are downloaded
4. Run the application with `go run cmd/main.go`

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
